## About

QuickServ makes creating web applications easy, no matter what programming
language you use. 

By relying on minimal dependencies, using sensible defaults, printing helpful
error messages, and passing data through standard input and output channels,
QuickServ lowers the barrier to creating interactive programs on the web.


## Get Started

Using QuickServ is as easy as downloading the program and running it in your

serve directly to the user. 

QuickServ is distributed as a single binary file. Download it for your operating system:
