# QuickServ

**Quick**, no-setup web **Serv**er


## About

This project was motivated by frustration with the prohibitive amount of
knowledge and setup effort required to create simple web applications. Its goal
is to enable users to quickly prototype web applications in any programming
language. By relying on minimal dependencies, using sensible defaults, and
passing data through standard input and output channels, QuickServ is designed
to lower the barrier to creating interactive programs on the web. In
particular, its target users are hackathon participants with minimal prior web
application development experience.


## Disclaimer

QuickServ is not designed for production use. It was not created to be fast or
secure. Using QuickServ in production puts your users and yourself at risk,
please do not do it.
